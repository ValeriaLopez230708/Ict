<h2>Fun Facts / Interesting Info</h2>
<p>I entered to the SCIS school in 4th grade and I really liked the school as its education is higher than many others. When I was a kid I wanted to become a veterinarian because I have a huge love for animals and my family's business is in the countryside so I had contact with many animals since a little kid.</p>
